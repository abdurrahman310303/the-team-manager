# Bug Fixes - Team Manager System

## 🐛 Issue Fixed: "Attempt to read property 'name' on null"

### Problem
The admin overview and user management pages were throwing errors because some users didn't have roles assigned, causing `$user->role->name` to fail when `$user->role` was null.

### Root Cause
1. Some users in the database had `role_id` set to null
2. Blade templates were accessing `$user->role->name` without null checks
3. The `groupBy('role.name')` in the controller was also failing for users without roles

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Blade Templates
Updated all admin views to include null checks:

**Before:**
```php
@if($user->role->name == 'admin') bg-red-100 text-red-800
@elseif($user->role->name == 'developer') bg-blue-100 text-blue-800
// ...
{{ $user->role->display_name }}
```

**After:**
```php
@if($user->role && $user->role->name == 'admin') bg-red-100 text-red-800
@elseif($user->role && $user->role->name == 'developer') bg-blue-100 text-blue-800
// ...
{{ $user->role ? $user->role->display_name : 'No Role' }}
```

#### 2. Fixed Controller Logic
Updated the `adminOverview` method to handle null roles:

**Before:**
```php
'users_by_role' => User::with('role')
    ->get()
    ->groupBy('role.name')
    ->map->count(),
```

**After:**
```php
'users_by_role' => User::with('role')
    ->get()
    ->groupBy(function($user) {
        return $user->role ? $user->role->name : 'no_role';
    })
    ->map->count(),
```

#### 3. Fixed Database Data
Assigned admin role to the user without a role:
```php
User::whereNull('role_id')->update(['role_id' => 1]);
```

### Files Modified
1. `/resources/views/admin/overview.blade.php`
2. `/resources/views/admin/users/index.blade.php`
3. `/resources/views/admin/users/show.blade.php`
4. `/app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`

### Result
- ✅ Admin overview page now loads without errors
- ✅ User management pages display properly
- ✅ Users without roles show "No Role" instead of causing errors
- ✅ Role grouping in statistics works correctly
- ✅ All role-related displays are now null-safe

### Testing
The system now handles:
- Users with assigned roles (displays role name and color)
- Users without roles (displays "No Role" in gray)
- Mixed scenarios with both types of users
- Role-based statistics and grouping

This fix ensures the admin interface is robust and handles edge cases gracefully.
