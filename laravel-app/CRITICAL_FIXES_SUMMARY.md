# Critical Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Overview Missing Variable Error
**Problem**: `ErrorException: Undefined variable $recent_activities` in admin overview
**Solution**: Updated `DashboardController@adminOverview` method to properly create and populate the `$recent_activities` collection with recent projects and proposals data.

### 2. Missing Project Views
**Problem**: `InvalidArgumentException: View [projects.create] not found`
**Solution**: Created all missing project views:
- `resources/views/projects/create.blade.php` - Project creation form
- `resources/views/projects/index.blade.php` - Projects listing page
- `resources/views/projects/show.blade.php` - Project details page
- `resources/views/projects/edit.blade.php` - Project editing form

All views use the black and white theme with proper styling and responsive design.

### 3. Daily Report Duplicate Constraint Violation
**Problem**: `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry` when creating daily reports
**Solution**: Added duplicate check in `DailyReportController@store` method to prevent creating multiple reports for the same user, date, and type. Now shows proper error message and redirects back with validation errors.

### 4. UI Improvements
**Problem**: Text visibility issues with white text on white background
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive black and white theme with:
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Proper contrast ratios for all text elements
- Status badges with appropriate colors
- Form styling with clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
